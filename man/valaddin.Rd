\title{valaddin: Functional Input Validation}
\description{
\emph{valaddin} provides a functional operator, \code{\link{firmly}}, that
enhances functions with input validation. You supply a function \code{f}
along with input validation requirements, and \code{firmly} returns a
function that applies \code{f} \dQuote{firmly}: before a call to \code{f} is
attempted, its inputs are checked, and if any check fails, an error halts
further execution with a message tabulating every failing check. Because
\code{firmly} implements input validation by operating on whole functions
rather than values, it is suitable for both programming and interactive use.
\cr\cr
Using \code{firmly} to add input validation to your functions improves the
legibility, reusability, and reliability of your code:
\itemize{
\item Emphasize the core logic of your functions by excising validation
boilerplate.
\item Reduce duplication by reusing common checks across functions with
common input requirements.
\item Make function outputs more predictable by constraining their inputs.
\item Vary the strictness of a function according to need and circumstance.
}
